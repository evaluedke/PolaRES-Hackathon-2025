## PolaRES-PISCO Hackathon Results 

Shared Results of the "Hack the Future - PolaRES-PISCO Hackathon" November 2025. Exploring cloud representation in regional climate models (RCMs) and comparison with satellite observations in the polar regions.

For this analysis, regional RCMs (ICON, RACMO, HCLIM, WRF) () driven by reanalysis (ERA5) and CMIP6 model data (CNRM-ESM2-1, NorESM2-MM, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, CESM2) based on a storyline approach (Levine et al., 2024; Williams et al., 2024) were used.
Observational data is based on cloud products produced by the Cloud project within the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) (Cloud_CCI) (Stengel et al., 2017) and CLARA-A3 derived from the AVHRR sensor onboard polar orbiting NOAA and METOP satellites (Karlsson et al., 2023).
